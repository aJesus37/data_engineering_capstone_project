    - **AA**: The Authoritative Answer bit for response messages specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in the question section.
    - **RA**: The Recursion Available bit in a response message indicates that the name server supports recursive queries.
    - **RD**: The Recursion Desired bit in a request message indicates that the client wants recursive service for this query.
    - **TC**: The Truncation bit specifies that the message was truncated.
    - **TTLs**: The caching intervals of the associated RRs described by the answers field.
    - **Z**: A reserved field that is usually zero in queries and responses.
    - **answers**: The set of resource descriptions in the query answer.
    - **id.orig_h**: Origin Host
    - **id.orig_p**: Origin Port
    - **id.resp_h**: Response Host
    - **id.resp_p**: Response Port
    - **proto**: The transport layer protocol of the connection.
    - **query**: The domain name that is the subject of the DNS query.
    - **rcode**: The response code value in DNS response messages.
    - **rcode_name**: A descriptive name for the response code value.
    - **rejected**: The DNS query was rejected by the server.
    - **trans_id**: A 16-bit identifier assigned by the program that generated the DNS query. Also used in responses to match up replies to outstanding queries.
    - **ts**: The earliest time at which a DNS protocol message over the associated connection is observed.
    - **uid**: A unique identifier of the connection over which DNS messages are being transferred.
    - **assigned_addr**: IP address assigned by the server.
    - **client_addr**: IP address of the client. If a transaction is only a client sending INFORM messages then there is no lease information exchanged so this is helpful to know who sent the messages. Getting an address in this field does require that the client sources at least one DHCP message using a non-broadcast address.
    - **domain**: Domain given by the server in option 15.
    - **duration**: Duration of the DHCP “session” representing the time from the first message to the last.
    - **lease_time**: IP address lease interval.
    - **mac**: Client’s hardware address.
    - **msg_types**: The DHCP message types seen by this DHCP transaction
    - **server_addr**: IP address of the server involved in actually handing out the lease. There could be other servers replying with OFFER messages which won’t be represented here. Getting an address in this field also requires that the server handing out the lease also sources packets from a non-broadcast IP address.
    - **uids**: A series of unique identifiers of the connections over which DHCP is occurring. This behavior with multiple connections is unique to DHCP because of the way it uses broadcast packets on local networks.
    - **acks**:     Total number of ACKs seen in the previous measurement interval.
    - **gaps**: Number of missed ACKs from the previous measurement interval.

    - **percent_lost**: Percentage of ACKs seen where the data being ACKed wasn’t seen.
    - **ts_delta**: The time delay between this measurement and the last.
    - **host**: The IP address detected running the software.
    - **name**: Name of the software (e.g. Apache).
    - **software_type**: The type of software detected (e.g. HTTP::SERVER).
    - **unparsed_version**: The full unparsed version string found because the version parsing doesn’t always work reliably in all cases and this acts as a fallback in the logs.
    - **version.major**: Major version number.
    - **version.minor**: Minor version number.
    - **notice**: Indicate if this weird was also turned into a notice.
    - **peer**: The peer that originated this weird. This is helpful in cluster deployments if a particular cluster node is having trouble to help identify which node is having trouble.
    - **source**: The source of the weird. When reported by an analyzer, this should be the name of the analyzer.

    - **local_resp**: If the connection is responded to locally, this value will be T. If it was responded to remotely it will be F. In the case that the Site::local_nets variable is undefined, this field will be left empty at all times.
    - **missed_bytes**: Indicates the number of bytes missed in content gaps, which is representative of packet loss. A value other than zero will normally cause protocol analysis to fail but some analysis may have been completed prior to the packet loss.
    - **orig_bytes**: The number of payload bytes the originator sent. For TCP this is taken from sequence numbers and might be inaccurate (e.g., due to large connections).
    - **resp_ip_bytes**: Number of IP level bytes that the responder sent (as seen on the wire, taken from the IP total_length header field). Only set if use_conn_size_analyzer = T.
    - **resp_pkts**: Number of packets that the responder sent. Only set if use_conn_size_analyzer = T.
    - **__corrupt_record**: Captures standard error when Zeek is started from ZeekControl

    - **filter**: The packet filter that is being set.
